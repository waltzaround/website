          <strong>Challenge</strong><br />
          New Zealanders were finding it frustrating to book their COVID-19 vaccinations. Existing services made it
          difficult to search vaccination bookings by available time and this resulted in hundreds of additional clicks.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Response</strong><br />
          We reverse engineered and scraped vaccination booking data. We then designed and built a better search
          experience for users in 48
          hours. <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/search?q=vaxx.nz&src=typed_query'>The
            public </a>seems to
          like it.

        <h3>Initial steps</h3>
        <p><br />
          A friend's wife complained about how hard it was to book a COVID-19 vaccine online.
          <br /><br />
          Every clinic and outlet close to her offering the vaccine had shown that the only bookings available were
          months away, and having
          to click through every outlet to see its individual availability was tiring.

          We gathered some mates on Discord as we had just gone into another Lockdown in New Zealand, and got to
          work.
          <br /><br />
          We did some technical scoping to see what was feasible with the data, and decided on a calendar approach to
          test with users in
          response. I opted for the bare minimum wireframing required to explain workflows and concepts and to keep
          everyone on the same page.<br /><br />
          <strong>Existing workflow:</strong> Search for a vaccination → 60 clicks through 30 different sites to check
          individual site availability →
          Make a booking<br />
          <strong>Our workflow:</strong> Search for a vaccination → One click on the day you want to get vaccinated →
          Make a booking

        <h3>Designing in a dev environment</h3>
        <p><br />
          Given that our little project was heavily constrained by dirty data pulled by hackily scraping govt websites,
          we had
          to be pragmatic with our design process. There were disgusting regexes, and dirty, dirty hacks everywhere. It
          was a painful balancing act in terms of product prioritization; on one hand you have the experience you want
          to test with the user, and at the other you have to contend with reality and what you can actually ship in
          a short amount of time. We ditched figma at this point and went straight into the frontend to save time on
          implementation.

        <h3>Initial launch</h3>
        <p><br />
          We launched on Twitter, Reddit and LinkedIn and gained a little bit of traffic initially, peaking at over
          23,000 unique users in a single day. As feedback came in over twitter and emails, improvements were
          prioritised using github projects. We started preparing to open the floodgates to contributors to scale as
          an open source project over discord and GitHub. To remain focused, I put together a triage workflow using
          Github issues and kanban boards.
